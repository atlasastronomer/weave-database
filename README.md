## Getting Started

To run this project locally, youâ€™ll need to clone both the frontend and backend repos, set up MongoDB and Cloudinary, and configure environment variables. Follow the step-by-step guide below.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a new directory  
2. Navigate to the new directory; clone frontend and backend repositories in the new directory  
3. MongoDB Database Configuration:  
   - Login/Signup to MongoDB Atlas  
   - Create new cluster  
   - Navigate to cluster  
   - Create new database  
   - In database, create the following collections: `avatars`, `blogs`, `links`, `posts`, `user`  
4. MongoDB Connection:  
   - Click **Connect** in your MongoDB Atlas dashboard  
   - Choose connection method **MongoDB for VS Code**  
   - Follow instructions to obtain connection string and save for later use (you'll use them in Steps 6 and 7)  
5. Cloudinary Configuration:  
   - Login/Signup to Cloudinary  
   - Navigate to Dashboard and create new app (if necessary)  
   - Find your **Cloud Name**, **API Key**, and **API Secret** on the dashboard  
   - Save these values for later use (you'll use them in Steps 6 and 7)  
6. In frontend directory:  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the directory  
   - Set up environment variables:  
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/ # Use the connection string obtained from Step 4
     VITE_PORT=3001
     SECRET=your_secret_key # Replace this with a long, random secret string
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
     CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
     ```  
7. In backend directory:  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the directory  
   - Set up environment variables  
   - Environment variables are identical to the ones in the frontend directory, only replace `VITE_PORT` with `PORT`  
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/ # Use the connection string obtained from Step 4
     PORT=3001
     SECRET=your_secret_key # Replace this with a long, random secret string
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
     CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
     ```
